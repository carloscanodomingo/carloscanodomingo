👋 Hi, I’m @carloscanodomingo

🎓 I hold a PhD in electromagnetic signal analysis, focusing on innovative methods including artificial intelligence. Currently, I am an Associate Professor at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in the Computer Science Department and an Associate Researcher at the CASE Department of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CSN). My work combines machine learning and optimization techniques for real-world applications such as battery modeling and time series analysis.

👨‍🏫 In addition to my research, I teach Machine Learning and Big Data Modelling Techniques to business students, focusing on making complex concepts like deep learning and data science accessible to non-programmers. I am passionate about bridging the gap between academia and industry, applying cutting-edge techniques to practical problems.

👀 My research interests span several key areas:

    🤖 Deep Learning Hybrid Techniques
    🔋 Lithium-Battery Modeling
    📊 Machine Learning Algorithms & Statistics
    🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning & Meta-Learning Algorithms
    💻 Embedded Programming in C/C++
    🌍 Earth-Ionosphere Resonance
    🦀 Rust Programming

💻 I have a strong background in developing algorithms for time series analysis, optimization, and battery degradation modeling, particularly using tools like PyTorch Lightning, Ray Tune, and MLflow. I'm also working on simulating electric vehicle behavior using high-performance computing.

🌱 I'm currently working on improving Recursive Electric Circuit Models (ECMs) for faster execution and resampling techniques for time-sensitive data.

💼 I’m eager to collaborate on projects involving Deep Learning algorithm development and related fields.
