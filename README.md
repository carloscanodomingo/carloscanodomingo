- 👋 Hi, I’m @carloscanodomingo I am PhD student at the University of Almeria, my thesis is centered on the study of the Schumann Resonance Signals(SR). 
SR are signals which propagate along the Earth-Ionosphere cavity. I am currently developing tools to explore the relation between SR and Ionospherics events usign Machine Learning Tecniques.
- 👀 I’m interested in mainly 5 topics.
  1. Signal Analysis, Signal processing and Stadistical Signal Characterization.
  2. Deep Learning Techniques, mainly for classification purpose at the moment. 
  3. Embedded programing. Since I was working in a Cutting edge Company in Bath as embedded desing engineer I have been working on different projects. 
  4. Server concurrent programing. Mainly interested in use Rust as a base to move also in the embedded world.
  5. Power Electronics. Due to the University program, i am the lab teacher of Power Electronics at my University and it is one of my research areas.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unsupervised clustering using Deep Learning and Rust programing Language.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of Deep Learning unsupervised clustering aplication usign Tensorflow.
